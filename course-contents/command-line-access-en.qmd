# Command line access


Command line usage skill is a necessary skill for the database developers and administrators.

- Production databases may not have necessary GUI tools installed.
- Remote servers, especially for linux servers, GUI tools may not work without additional work, (ssh tunneling etc)
- Some Oracle problems (like startup failures) could only be solved using command line.



## sqlite

- [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html)

## Oracle

- [sqlplus](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqpug/SQL-Plus-quick-start.html)

Oracle also provides java based more modern command line interface.
