# Database concepts isolation

Isolation is the I of ACID acronym.

As mentioned before, Isolation guarantees that multiple transactions occur concurrently without seeing each other.
For example, one transaction update a row in Customer table, second transaction will not see this update row.

Isolation prevents Read Phenomenas of dirty reads,non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
For example, isolation ensures that two users could not change same row at the same time.
