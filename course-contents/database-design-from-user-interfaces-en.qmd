# Database Design from User Interfaces

Why ability to design relational databases from user interfaces are important skill to have?


Modernization of old software is very much necessary in our industry.
See a recent example, December 2024, of old software usage.
[Indiana bakery still uses Commodore 64s](https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/indiana-bakery-still-using-commodore-64s-originally-released-in-1982-as-point-of-sale-terminals) in 2024.
This bakery will certainly need to rewrite this software in the future.


Another example is main frame usage.
