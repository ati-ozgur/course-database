## Second Normal Form


Second normal form is only relevant when the key is composite key.
That is when your key consists of at least two columns.
This is about natural keys, even if you add synthetic key to your table, if your natural keys are composite, this situation persists.

Consider following example by @Kent1983simple, example table is slightly changed and example data is added for better understanding.


| Equipment | Warehouse        | Quantity | Warehouse-Address        |
|-----------|------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Laptop    | Main Warehouse   | 50       | 123 Main St, Cityville   |
| Printer   | Main Warehouse   | 20       | 123 Main St, Cityville   |
| Monitor   | Branch Warehouse | 15       | 456 Branch Ave, Suburbia |
| Laptop    | Branch Warehouse | 10       | 456 Branch Ave, Suburbia |


Here, composite natural key is equipment and warehouse.
But, warehouse address is a fact about warehouse not about this whole key.
The problems of this design as follows:

1. Warehouse address repeated
2. If a warehouse address changed, every row in this table for this warehouse has to be changed.
3. Since data is redundant, address information may be updated wrongly. (Update anomaly)
4. If at a point of time, there is no equipment in a given address, we loose the address information

To change this to 2nd normal form.

1. First normal form should be satisfied.
2. We need to divide this table to two tables as follows.


| Equipment | Warehouse        | Quantity |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Laptop    | Main Warehouse   | 50       |
| Printer   | Main Warehouse   | 20       |
| Monitor   | Branch Warehouse | 15       |
| Laptop    | Branch Warehouse | 10       |


| Warehouse        | Warehouse-Address        |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Main Warehouse   | 123 Main St, Cityville   |
| Main Warehouse   | 123 Main St, Cityville   |
| Branch Warehouse | 456 Branch Ave, Suburbia |
| Branch Warehouse | 456 Branch Ave, Suburbia |
