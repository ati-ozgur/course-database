# Database Design 5 normal forms

Normalization aims to make insert,updates and deletes more understandable and clear.
Normalization is about how the data is stored not how the data is retrieved.
In fact, normalization process divides tables to more tables.
Then to be able retrieve data in the same format these divided tables have to be joined @Codd1990relational.
Thus, this joining tables may slightly slow down data access.
To repeat, the normalization process improves data quality by reducing duplication and inconsistencies.

An excellent article about this topic is A simple guide to five normal forms in relational database theory @Kent1983simple.
