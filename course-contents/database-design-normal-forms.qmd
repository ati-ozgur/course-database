# Database Design 5 normal forms

An excellent article about this topic is A simple guide to five normal forms in relational database theory @Kent1983simple.
Below examples about the normalization are taken from the same article.

The normalization process improves data quality by reducing duplication and inconsistencies.
However, this may slightly slow down data access since full data needs to be accessed using joining tables.

## 1st Normal Form

In the first normal form, all records must contain same number of fields.
The first normal form forbids repeating fields and groups.
This is actually a design guideline since relational database theory does not deals with variable number of fields.
