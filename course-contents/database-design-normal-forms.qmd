# Normalization

Normalization aims to make insert,updates and deletes more understandable and clear.
Normalization is about how the data is stored not how the data is retrieved.
In fact, normalization process divides a given table to more tables.
Then to be able retrieve data in the same format, these divided tables have to be joined @Codd1990relational.
This joining of tables may slightly slow down data access.
To repeat, the normalization process improves data quality by reducing duplication and inconsistencies.

An excellent oldie but goodie article about this topic is "A simple guide to five normal forms in relational database theory" by @Kent1983simple.

The basic ideas of normalization (@Codd1990relational) are follows: 

- Every table should have a primary key
- Every cell (value in given row and column) in table is identified by the primary key.
- every cell contains only atomic (single) values. 

There are 11 different types of normalization according to wikipedia page of database normalization (@Wikipedia2018Database).
But first three normal forms are most important.
These 3 normal forms prevent insert,update and delete anomalies.
In fact, when your tables are in 3rd normal form, they are considered in normalized form.

We will cover only these three normal forms since this is an introductory course.
