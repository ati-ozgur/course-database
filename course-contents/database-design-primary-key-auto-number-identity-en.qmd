## Auto number (identity)

The synthetic key can be generated on the database side or on the application side that accesses the database. 
The most preferred form of synthetic key on the database side is automatic number generation.
This Auto Number strategy is supported by many databases:

- Sqlite
- SQL Server
- Oracle 12c+
- MySQL
- IBM DB2

Auto Number columns are bound to the database table and each time an Insert clause is executed, the next automatically generate the value.
