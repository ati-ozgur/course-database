# Primary Key

In relational databases, primary keys identify the records in a table as unique. 
The benefit of finding a record as unique is that querying and updating this record is much faster with this key. 
Similarly, relationships between tables are maintained by foreign keys that are linked to primary keys. 

For example, suppose we have PERSON and PERSON_TRAINING tables. 
Which trainings a person has received is tracked using the Person primary key in the PERSON_TRAINING table. 
Therefore, primary key selection is very important in database design.

There are 2 different ideas in primary key selection: Natural Key and Synthetic Key.

Before explaining the differences, pros and cons between the two, let me state that I am in favor of synthetic keys.
