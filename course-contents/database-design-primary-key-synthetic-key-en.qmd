## Surrogate Key

Instead of selecting a Natural Key, automatically generated keys can be used as primary keys. 
The advantage is that if the natural key changes, the records in the database are not affected by this situation.
Another advantage is that even in case of lack of information in the initial data entries, data can be recorded with the existing information.
Others are the convenience in back-end programming and queries.

In the example given earlier with PERSON and TcIdentityNo in the natural key, if TcIdentityNo changes will only affect the PERSON table. 
In this case, de-coupling will be provided between the domain and the application.


But the most effective argument for the synthetic key is the convenience it brings to programmers. 
It makes it easier to write code with the appropriate strategy.


The disadvantage of synthetic keys is that they are often less understandable.
This is especially true for universally unique identifiers (UUID/GUID).

In table @tbl-table-primary-key-synthetic-key-sample-person-table, KisiKey is selected as synthetic key. 
In this table, duplicate entries of TcKimlikNo can be prevented by adding a unique index on TcKimlikNo


|    PERSON    |    |
|:------------:|:--:|
| PersonKey    | PK |
| TcIdentityNo |    |
| FirstName    |    |
| LastName     |    |

One of the important points to note about synthetic keys is that they should not be used to add business meaning. 
For example, the room numbers given to companies by chambers of commerce are usually a synthetic key generated by databases. 
But here they have business meaning attached to them. 


An example of this can be seen in the figure @fig-synthetic-key-used-like-natural-key.
This example is taken from an old version of chamber of commerce software.
How true or false this situation is is a matter of debate.

the Synthetic Key vs. Natural Key debate has turned into a religious debate in some places.
Remember that there is never one right way to design a database.
It is your application. 
Choose the most appropriate strategy according to your requirements.
