## Server Client

{{< include ../course-contents/diagrams/database-client-server-en.md >}}

## File based

In file based architecture, a local file is used as database.
There is no server, everything is done in the client computer.
Sqlite and Microsoft Access are well known file based databases.

### In memory

Everything is stored in the memory.
Thus when the client process ends, database contents are also lost.
In memory databases are used for testing and caching.
Sqlite could work as [in memory database](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html).
