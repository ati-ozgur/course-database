# Entity Relationship (ER) modelling 

## Entity Relationship modeling Basics

Entity Relationship (ER) modeling or diagramming is introduce by Peter Chen @Chen1976entity in 1976.
ER-Models consists of three parts

- Entity
- Relations
- Attributes

Entities are basically tables in databases, like Student, Employee, Customer and Invoices.
Relations shows the connections between entities.
For example, a Customer has invoices.
Attributes shows the values an entity have: For example, Customer entity will have name and phone.

Original syntax is called Chen notation.
Below is an figure from the original article @Chen1976entity.

The diagramming syntax is evolved by then but the basics stayed same.



## How it works



ER-modelling work two ways, as below figure shows.
We could create first diagram then from diagram database tables.
Or we could reverse engineer our diagrams from our database.
