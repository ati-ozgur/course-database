## Mermaid ER Diagrams

We use [mermaid Entity Relationship Diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html) for diagramming since it is more easily understood and it is version controllable with tools like git.


## Entity

Entities are most basic part in the diagrams.
They correspond to database tables normally.
We can also give their attributes or columns in the diagram too.
See below example.


```{mermaid}
%%| echo: true

erDiagram
	Student {
	    int student_id PK
	    string name
	}
```
