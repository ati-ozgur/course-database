# Mermaid ER Diagrams

We use [mermaid Entity Relationship Diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html) for diagramming since markdown syntax of mermaid is more easily understood and markdown as plain text is version controllable with source control tools like git.
Also mermaid diagrams are automatically rendered by web versions of source control tools such as github, gitlab and azure devops.
