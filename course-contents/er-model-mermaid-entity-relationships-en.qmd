 
### Entity Relationships

Entities should have relationships.
That is how they interact with other entities.
The syntax for it is below:

```
<first-entity> [<relationship> <second-entity> : <relationship-label>]
```


Relationship label should show how it works in the requirements or domain.
Please try to choose it accordingly.

An example a student enrolls in many courses.
We could write it like below.


```{mermaid}
%%| echo: true
erDiagram
    Student ||--o{ Course : enrolls
```

In this syntax, following table shows how we can model cardinality of the entities.
That is 0,1 or many information between the entities.


{{< include ../course-contents/tables/table-er-mermaid-cardinality-en.md >}}

We can read this information following way then

- Student has zero to one advisor
- Student has exactly one advisor
- Student enrolls in 0-to-many courses
- Student enrolls in 1-to-many courses
