## ER model reverse engineering tools


Second way of working, reverse engineering existing database is more common.
We reverse engineer an already existing database and get ER Diagram of it.
For example, DBeaver has ER Diagrams.

1. Open a connection
2. select tables 
3. in the opened window, select ER Diagram tab

Reading ER diagrams is useful skill to have since it allows you to more easily understand existing database structure.

[See oracle sample HR and OE example in their documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/comsc/schema-diagrams.html#GUID-01BFEF14-C6BD-42CD-8558-DDD214DB3AE0)

Oracle SQL Developer has its own reverse engineering tools for oracle database.
TODO add links.

Another tool for this purpose is Schema Spy.
