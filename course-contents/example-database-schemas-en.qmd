## Examples schema from database vendors

There are some well known sample databases that was provided by database vendors like Oracle and Microsoft.
Some of these samples are discontinued due to bad practices in them.
Nonetheless, we will learn about them even though, we may not run any queries in these example schemas.
It is necessary to know about them since they are used in a lot of examples.
