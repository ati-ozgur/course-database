# Open Source vs Enterprise Databases

The big companies and government still heavily rely on enterprise databases.

- Oracle
- SQL Server
- IBM DB2

But small to mid sized companies started to work with mostly open source databases in recent decade.
10 years ago, it was almost impossible to use open source databases in the large companies but mindset is shifted.
Even in large companies and government, you can find open source databases like postgre and mysql since small applications use them.
