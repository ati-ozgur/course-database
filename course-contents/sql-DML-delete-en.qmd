# SQL DML Delete

Delete statements is used to delete rows in the tables.
Delete statements should always be used together with where clause.
If where clause is forgotten, then **every row** in the table is deleted.


Following sql will work on command line normally.


```sql
Delete from Employee
```

But dbeaver gives a warning for dangerous sql.
But be aware that not every tool gives this warning.
Especially, programmatic connections run every sql normally.

See following database specific documentation

- [sqlite delete](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_delete.html)


## Single row


For single row delete, we should use where PK_Column = value filter in our delete statements.
Following delete statement will only delete the row with employee id 5 value.


```sql
DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeId=5; 
```


## Multiple rows

Before deleting multiple values with update statements, we should first run the select count(*) statement to see how many rows we are deleting and this row count is consistent with our expectations.


Following sql return 3, 

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customer 
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%'
```

then corresponding delete statement will delete 3 rows.

```sql
DELETE FROM Customer
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%'; 
```
