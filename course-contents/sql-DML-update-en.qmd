# SQL DML Update

Update statements is used to update rows in the tables.
Update should always be used with where clause.
If where clause is forgotten, then **every row** in the table is updated.


Following sql will work on command line normally.


```sql
UPDATE Employee
SET City='DENEME'
```

But dbeaver gives a warning for dangerous sql.
But be aware that not every tool gives this warning.
Especially, programmatic connections run every sql normally.

See following database specific documentation

- [sqlite update](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_update.html)

## Single row

For single row update, we should use where PK_Column = value filter in our update statements.
Following update statement will only update the row with employee id 5 value.


```sql
UPDATE Employee
SET City='DENEME'
WHERE EmployeeId=5; 
```


## Multiple rows

Before updating multiple values with update statements, we should first run the select count(*) statement to see how many rows we are updating and this row count is consistent with our expectations.


Following sql return 3, 

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customer 
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%'
```

then corresponding update statement will update 3 rows.

```sql
UPDATE Customer
SET City='DENEME'
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%'; 
```
