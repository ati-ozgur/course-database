# SQL Command Types

There are [five different sql commands types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dql-dml-dcl-tcl-commands/).

- DDL (Data Definition Language)
- DQL (Data Query Language)
- DML (Data Manipulation Language)
- DCL (Data Control Language)
- TCL (Transaction Control Language)

## DQL vs DML

Normal SELECT command is clearly DQL but distinction between DQL and DML when it comes to other select statements is not clear.
Some says that adding joins, group by and other commands make that commands DML.

Nonetheless, INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and other statements are clearly DML.

Also dialects could decide about the statements for example TRUNCATE Table command is DML in SQL Server but DDL in Oracle.
