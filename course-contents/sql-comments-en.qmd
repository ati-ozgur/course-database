# SQL Comments

Normal sql comments are double dash -- characters.
They could start anywhere in the line and whatever written after -- characters in that line is ignored by database engine.
Comments can appear anywhere white space can come.

See below example

``` sql
SELECT
 * -- here character * means all columns
FROM Employee;

```


C style /* */ multi line comments are also supported by a lot of different databases, like [Sqlite comments](https://sqlite.org/lang_comment.html), [oracle comments](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/Comments.html) and [SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/slash-star-comment-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). 


``` sql

/*
This is a 
Multi line
comment
*/

```
