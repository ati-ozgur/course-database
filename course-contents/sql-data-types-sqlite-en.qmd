## Sqlite Data Types


As [Datatypes In SQLite](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html) page says, sqlite uses dynamic typing.
Other databases like oracle and sql server used static or strict typing.



Dynamic typing vs static typing is almost a religious war between their proponents.
Therefore, we will not discuss it a lot but we will talk about how it differs and what could you expect.

Also, with after version 3.37.0 (2021-11-27), SQLite provides STRICT tables, see [same page](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html).


Lets see an example:

First create a table with two integer column, first one will primary key.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE DynamicTyping (
	DynamicTypingId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	ColumnNumber INTEGER
);
```
Then insert some values: 

``` sql
INSERT INTO DynamicTyping (ColumnNumber) VALUES(2020);
INSERT INTO DynamicTyping (ColumnNumber) VALUES(1);
INSERT INTO DynamicTyping (ColumnNumber) VALUES(2021);
```

and select that values:

``` sql
SELCT * FROM DynamicTyping;
```


Okay, it works as normal.
Now, try to insert a name to ColumnNumber:

``` sql
INSERT INTO DynamicTyping (ColumnNumber) VALUES('Atilla');
```


``` sql
SELCT * FROM DynamicTyping;
```

This also works.
This is the dynamic typing of sqlite.
The values are
