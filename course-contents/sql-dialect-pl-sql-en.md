# SQL Dialect PL/SQL

[PL/SQL by Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/plsql.html) is procedural extensions to SQL language by Oracle.
See their definition below:

> PL/SQL is a procedural language designed specifically to embrace SQL statements within its syntax. 
> PL/SQL program units are compiled by the Oracle Database server and stored inside the database. And at run-time, both PL/SQL and SQL run within the same server process, bringing optimal efficiency. 
>PL/SQL automatically inherits the robustness, security, and portability of the Oracle Database.
