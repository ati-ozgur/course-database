## SQL dialect Transact-SQL


[Transact-SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference?view=sql-server-ver16) is the procedural extensions that Microsoft and Sybase have added to the SQL standard.

From their website:

> T-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL products and services. All tools and applications that communicate with a SQL Server database do so by sending T-SQL commands.
