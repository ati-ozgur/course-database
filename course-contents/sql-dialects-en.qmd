## SQL dialects

Even though SQL are set of standards, different database engines and companies may implement these standards differently.

An example of these differences is basic command SELECT.
If select works only **with from** or **without from**.

From modern-sql website [select without from](https://modern-sql.com/use-case/select-without-from): 

> Letâ€™s get that straight from the beginning: select without from is not standard conforming SQL. Full stop.

But select without from works in SQL server and sqlite.
See below example queries

**sqlite**

``` sql
SELECT DATE('now');
```

**Sql Server**

``` sql
SELECT GETDATE()  
```

But in oracle, to get same information, you need to use dummy table called **dual**.
You cannot run select without from in Oracle database.

**Oracle**

``` sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE FROM dual;
```



They may also add extensions to SQL standard like procedural language elements.



## SQL dialect sqlite

Even though, sqlite has no formal name for its extensions, commands like .schema, .table, .explain allows us to manage sqlite databases and could be described as sqlite dialect.
