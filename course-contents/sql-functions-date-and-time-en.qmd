# sql date-and-time functions

Every database supports date and time functions but their name could be a little different.
We will see examples from sqlite.

[Date functions in sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html)


> SQLite does not have a dedicated date/time datatype. Instead, date and time values can stored as any of the following:

> ISO-8601	A text string that is an ISO 8601 date/time value. Example: '2025-05-29 14:16:00'
> Julian day number	The number of days including fractional days since -4713-11-24 12:00:00 Example: 2460825.09444444
> Unix timestamp	The number of seconds including fractional seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 Example: 1748528160


ISO-8601 syntax is more natural; therefore, I suggest you to use it.

But unix timestamp is also widely used and all programming languages provides support for unix timestamp.
See below for c# example

```sql
DateTime value = DateTime.UtcNow;
long unixTime = ((DateTimeOffset)value).ToUnixTimeSeconds();
```
