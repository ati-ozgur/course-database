## Inner Join Syntax


Correct syntax for joins ANSI-SQL-92 is below syntax.

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM   Table1 JOIN Table2
ON  Table1.KolonA = Table2.KolonA;
```

**Chinook example**

Join 2 tables, Artist and Album

```sql
SELECT A.Name AS ArtistName
, B.Title AS AlbumTitle
FROM Artist A
INNER JOIN Album B
ON A.ArtistId  = B.ArtistId 
```

Join 3 tables, Artist, Album and Track.

```sql
SELECT A.Name AS ArtistName
, B.Title AS AlbumTitle
, T.Name  AS TrackName
FROM Artist A
INNER JOIN Album B
ON A.ArtistId  = B.ArtistId 
INNER JOIN Track T ON T.AlbumId  = B.AlbumId   
```


**note ANSI-SQL-89 inner join syntax**

You may see below syntax for inner join but please do not use it.
Using join condition explicitly would always be better.


```sql
SELECT ...
FROM   Table1, Table2
WHERE  Table1.KolonA = Table2.KolonA;
```

It will still works in all databases but giving join conditions using join keyword is always better.
Additionally ANSI-SQL-92 syntax for left and right joins are more understandable.
