# SQL Working with NULL


- NULL is used for unknown or missing values.
- null means "unknown" so that any comparison or operation results in unknown. 
- for mathematical operations and logical operations, you may think null as $\infty$ in calculus.



- $\infty$ $!=$ $\infty$
- NULL $!=$ NULL
- 3 + NULL = NULL
- 'string value' + NULL = NULL

- for comparisons, null comparison always return false.

    * NULL = NULL returns false
    * NULL IS NULL returns true


sqlite
``` sql
select null = null;
```

``` sql
select null is null;
```

oracle

``` sql
SELECT  * FROM dual WHERE NULL = NULL;


SELECT  * FROM dual WHERE NULL IS NULL;
```
