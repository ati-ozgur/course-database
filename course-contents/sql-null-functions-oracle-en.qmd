## SQL NULL functions Oracle

**coalesce**

See, sql standard. 

**NVL**

NVL function allows you to replace a null value with default value.
If first argument is null, second argument of NVL is returned.
Coalesce function is more powerful than nvl and coalesce also works in other databases.
Use coalesce, do not use NVL.


``` sql
SELECT NVL(NULL,'DEFAUL VALUE') FROM DUAL;
```
