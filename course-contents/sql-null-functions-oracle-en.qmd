## SQL NULL functions Oracle

**COALESCE**

See, SQL standard. 

**NULLIF**

See, SQL standard. 


**NVL(x,y)**

NVL function allows you to replace a null value with default value.
If first argument is null, second argument of NVL is returned.
Coalesce function is more powerful than nvl and coalesce also works in other databases.
Use coalesce, do not use NVL.


``` sql
SELECT NVL(NULL,'DEFAUL VALUE') FROM DUAL;
```

**NVL2(x,y,z)**

NVL2 works with 3 parameters.
If x is not null, it returns y.
If x is null, it returns z.

This function could also be replaced with coalesce easily.
Do not use it.


``` sql
SELECT NVL2(NULL,'Y','Z') FROM DUAL;
```

``` sql
SELECT NVL2('NOT NULL','Y','Z') FROM DUAL;
```
