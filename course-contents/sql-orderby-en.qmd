- Order by

A simple user interface usage of order by cities.
For example, in an address selection drop box down list, we would like to see most important cities first.

In the below examples, we see cities ordered by names only.

```sql
SELECT CityId, CityName from Cities
ORDER BY  CityName
```

In the below example, we would see 

- İstanbul
- Ankara
- Adana
- ...

since OrderPriority values in İstanbul and Ankara is higher than other cities.


```sql
SELECT CityId, CityName, OrderPriority from Cities
ORDER BY OrderPriority DESC, CityName ASC
```
