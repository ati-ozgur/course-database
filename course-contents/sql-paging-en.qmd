# SQL Paging

Paging Results - Can be done by using the OFFSET-FETCH command with ORDER BY.


- Depends on the use of ORDER BY.
- It is used to specify how many rows to skip and how many rows to fetch.
- The database has to count all rows until it gets to the desired page.
- There are performance problems. [See following link.](http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/fetch-next-page).
