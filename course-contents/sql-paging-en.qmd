# SQL Paging

Paging means that bringing partial results from a table or result set.
Since bringing all of the rows to the customer application is expensive, customer applications, for example web pages, show the rows in pages.
A web page could show 100 rows per page, while a mobile application could show 10 rows per page.
You can see google paging of search results in the below image.

## SQL Standard Offset Fetch Commands

Paging Results - Can be done by using the OFFSET-FETCH command with ORDER BY.


```sql
SELECT * FROM Production.Product;
```




- Depends on the use of ORDER BY.
- It is used to specify how many rows to skip and how many rows to fetch.
- The database has to count all rows until it gets to the desired page.

- There are performance problems. See following pages: [fetch-next-page](http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/fetch-next-page) and [no offset](https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset).
