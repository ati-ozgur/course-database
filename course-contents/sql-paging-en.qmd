# SQL Paging

Paging means that bringing partial results from a table or result set.
Since bringing all of the rows to the customer application is expensive, customer applications, for example web pages, show the rows in pages.
A web page could show 100 rows per page, while a mobile application could show 10 rows per page.
You can see google paging of search results in the below image.

## SQL Standard Offset Fetch Commands

Paging Results - Can be done by using the OFFSET-FETCH command with ORDER BY.

Note that this usage is easy to use but problematic.
Offset usage has large performance problems.
Read about it [here](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/fetch-next-page).


In the below example, in oracle database, we select 3rd page with 10 rows.
This query will not work on sql server since sql server mandates usage of order by while using offset and fetch.

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Customer" 
OFFSET 20 ROWS
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
```


- 0-10 1st page
- 10-20 2nd page
- 20-30 3rd page


- OFFSET is used to specify how many rows to skip 
- FETCH is used to specify how many rows to fetch.


- Better to use ORDER BY.

Since this result is dependent on how Customer is stored, it is better to give order by always, like below example.
Below query works both oracle and sql server databases.
It should also work on DB2 and postgres with small or no modifications.  


```sql
SELECT * FROM "Customer" 
ORDER BY "FirstName" 
OFFSET 20 ROWS
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;

```

Since database has to fetch all rows until it gets to desired result, this usage has performance problems.
See following pages: [fetch-next-page](http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/fetch-next-page) and [no offset](https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset).

But for a quick and dirty paging, it is better than client side paging.
That is getting all rows in the client application and filtering there.

We do not have to select from single table only.
We could have complex queries and better yet we could use sub-queries or with expression with this syntax.

```sql
WITH P AS
(
	SELECT C."CustomerId",C."FirstName",C."LastName" FROM "Customer" C
	WHERE C."SupportRepId" IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT * FROM P
ORDER BY "FirstName"
OFFSET 20 ROWS
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

## SQLITE

sqlite supports offset keyword with limit.

```sql
WITH P AS
(
	SELECT C.CustomerId,C.FirstName,C.LastName FROM Customer C
	WHERE C.SupportRepId IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT * FROM P
ORDER BY FirstName
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```
