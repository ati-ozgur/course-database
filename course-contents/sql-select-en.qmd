# SQL Select

## SQL most basic select example


The most basic select example according to SQL standard will be as following

```sql
SELECT * FROM TableName;
```

According to SQL Standard, from is required in the select statements but some databases like SQL Server and sqlite allow select statements without from.


```sql
SELECT 2+2;
```

We could order select statements in two ways.

1. Syntax ordering: How we write them
2. Semantic ordering: how the database engine process them

We will do give two ordering for simple cases and we will build upon them.
