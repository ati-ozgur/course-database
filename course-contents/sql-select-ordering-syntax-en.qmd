## SQL Select syntax ordering 1


Following order is taken from [from sql server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) and simplified.

- SELECT select_list 
- FROM table_source
- [ WHERE search_condition ]
- [ GROUP BY group_by_expression ]
- [ HAVING search_condition ]
- [ ORDER BY order_expression [ ASC | DESC ]]


Syntax ordering is how we should write the select statements.
Below table gives the meaning of keywords.
