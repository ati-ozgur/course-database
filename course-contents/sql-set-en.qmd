## EXCEPT

Second result set is removed from first result set.
EXCEPT key word is SQL standard.


```sql
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
EXCEPT
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
```

55 rows

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
EXCEPT
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
```

6 rows.




## INTERSECT

Intersection of the both result sets are the output.


```sql
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
INTERSECT
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
```
2 rows

That is only 2 first names are same in Customer and Employee tables.


## Oracle

Except is SQL standard but oracle also accept MINUS keyword.
It is functionality is the same.
Oracle also accepts ALL to EXCEPT ALL and MINUS ALL so that duplicated will not be removed, same as UNION ALL.
