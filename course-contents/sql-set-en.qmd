# SQL SET Operations


- UNION [ALL]
- EXCEPT
- INTERSECT

## UNION

- Combines different (DISTINCT) results from multiple SELECT commands.
- UNION remove duplicate records from the query result, so performance is affected.

See below example:

```sql
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
```
59 rows


We have 59 rows in our Customer table.

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
```

8 rows


We have 8 rows in our Employee table.


```sql
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
UNION
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
```

63 rows

But when we combine all of the first names using **UNION** we get 63 rows not 59+8 = 67 rows.
UNION set operator remove duplicates from the result.
Here we have 4 duplicate first names.




- UNION ALL works faster because it does not deal with duplicate records.
- UNION ALL should be used wherever possible for performance reasons.


```sql
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
UNION ALL
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
```

67 rows

When we use **UNION ALL**, we get 59+8 = 67 rows. 
If we order the result set using a subquery we could see duplicates more clearly.
In the below query, we are using from subquery.

```sql
SELECT * FROM
(
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
UNION ALL
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
)
ORDER BY FirstName
```

- Column aliases should be written in the first query.
- Column numbers must be the same in all queries that are combined.
- Column data structures should be either implicitly translated or explicitly translated (Explicit Conversion).
- For example SELECT cast( GETDATE() as varchar(12))


## EXCEPT

Second result set is removed from first result set.
EXCEPT key word is SQL standard.


```sql
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
EXCEPT
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
```

55 rows

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
EXCEPT
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
```

6 rows.




## INTERSECT

Intersection of the both result sets are the output.


```sql
SELECT c.FirstName FROM Customer c
INTERSECT
SELECT e.FirstName FROM Employee e
```
2 rows

That is only 2 first names are same in Customer and Employee tables.


## Oracle

Except is SQL standard but oracle also accept MINUS keyword.
It is functionality is the same.
Oracle also accepts ALL to EXCEPT ALL and MINUS ALL so that duplicated will not be removed, same as UNION ALL.
