### Example questions for Intersect 

#### Common column names in two different tables

Consider following two tables, Employee and Customer.
Write a query that will find which names are common in Employee and Customer tables.


```{mermaid}
erDiagram
    Employee {
        int employee_id
        text employee_name
    }
    Customer {
        int customer_id
        text customer_name
    }  
```

This question could also be solved by using inner join but set operation intersect is more easier to understand.
Following query will give use 

```sql
    SELECT employee_name FROM Employee;
    INTERSECT
    SELECT customer_name FROM Customer;
```

**chinook example**

If we run similar example for chinook database, we would run following query.


```sql
SELECT c.FirstName from Customer c
INTERSECT
SELECT e.FirstName from Employee e 
```

results will be two names below.
