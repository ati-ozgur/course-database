# SQL Stored Procedures

There are no stored procedures in sqlite but both oracle and sql server have them.

A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements in data dictionary.
These SQL statements are mostly dialects of given database, PL-SQL and T-SQL.
You could call these procedures using their name.


I personally do not like to use stored procedures much since they are hard to control using standard version control (git) systems.
Most of the time, writing necessary code in given backend code is a better choice.
But database vendors provide a lot of ready to use stored procedures.
Instead of writing custom code, using these ready stored procedures or functions is a always better.



## Oracle Stored Procedure

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE Create_Employee 
(firstname IN varchar2,
lastname IN varchar2 , 
id OUT number)
IS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO CHINOOK."Employee" 
  ( "LastName", "FirstName") 
  VALUES(firstname,lastname) 
  returning "EmployeeId" into id;   
END;

```

show dbeaver Procedures 
execute Procedure

```sql
CALL CHINOOK.CREATE_EMPLOYEE('Atilla', 'Ozgur', ?);
```
