# SQL Stored Procedures

There are no stored procedures in sqlite but both oracle and sql server have them.

A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements in data dictionary.
These SQL statements are mostly dialects of given database, PL-SQL and T-SQL.
You could call these procedures using their name.


I personally do not like to use stored procedures much since they are hard to control using standard version control (git) systems.
Most of the time, writing necessary code in given backend code is a better choice.
But database vendors provide a lot of ready to use stored procedures.
Instead of writing custom code, using these ready stored procedures or functions is a always better.



## Oracle Stored Procedure

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE Create_Employee 
(firstname IN varchar2,
lastname IN varchar2 , 
id OUT number)
IS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO CHINOOK."Employee" 
  ( "LastName", "FirstName") 
  VALUES(firstname,lastname) 
  returning "EmployeeId" into id;   
END;

```

1. Open Procedures folder in oracle dbeaver chinook connection
2. refresh this folder to see the create stored procedure
3. Use mouse right click and select **execute procedure**, see image below.

![dbeaver-oracle-execute-procedure](images/dbeaver-oracle-execute-procedure.png){width=100mm}


4. In the opened window, you will see following sql.

```sql
CALL CHINOOK.CREATE_EMPLOYEE(:FIRSTNAME, :LASTNAME, ?);
```

5. Change the variables, with your first name and last name like below.

```sql
CALL CHINOOK.CREATE_EMPLOYEE('Atilla', 'Özgür', ?);
```

6. execute the script. In the results window, you should see the newly inserted employee id.
