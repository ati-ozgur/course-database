## SQL Server Stored Procedure Example

1. Open the chinook sql server connection

2. copy paste the following script to a new script window


```sql

CREATE PROCEDURE Create_Employee
(
    @FirstName nvarchar(50) = NULL,
    @LastName nvarchar(50) = NULL
)
AS
BEGIN
DECLARE @ID int

INSERT INTO Employee
( LastName, FirstName) 
VALUES(@FirstName,@LastName) 

  SELECT @ID = scope_identity();
  RETURN @ID
END

```

3. Run the script to create the stored procedure

4. Unfortunately, current version of dbeaver does not support sql server stored procedure in GUI.

4. Open a new script window and copy paste the following script

```sql
DECLARE @RC int
EXECUTE @RC = Create_Employee 'Atilla','Özgür'
SELECT @RC
```

5. execute the script. 
6. If we check it in table, we see that new employee inserted but dbeaver community edition does not show id information.

If we execute same query in microsoft tools, we see the new inserted id.
For example vscode sql server extension shows the id value.
See below image:

In the results window, you should see the newly inserted employee id.
