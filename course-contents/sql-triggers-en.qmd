# SQL Triggers

Triggers are automatic run operations when a specified events occurs.
Triggers are powerful concept but they should be rarely used in my opinion since they make understanding of database harder.

Most common events for triggers are data manipulation language (DML) events.

- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

All three, oracle, sql server and sqlite, supports DML or table triggers

- [Sqlite Triggers](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html)
- [Sql Server DML Triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/triggers/dml-triggers?view=sql-server-ver16)
- [Oracle Triggers](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/tdddg/using-triggers.html)




## Logon triggers


SQL server and oracle supports log on triggers when users logged in databases.
These type of triggers are meaningless in sqlite since it is file based database.

- [Sql Server Logon Trigger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/triggers/logon-triggers?view=sql-server-ver16)

Oracle Logon triggers are especially useful to change default schema for application users.
See below example for specific user.
We do not want to use schema user itself since it has unlimited privileges in its own schema.
In oracle, it is better to use application user and change the default schema of application user.
This is necessary in oracle since every schema is also a user in oracle database.



```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER set_default_schema
AFTER LOGON ON DATABASE
BEGIN
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA = your_schema_name';
END;
```

## DDL (Data Definition Language) triggers

These triggers corresponds to DDL events, 
see database specific pages.
These triggers could be used for simple version control of databases where for example you will log every create/alter/drop staments to a table.
I suggest that this table should be unaccessible to developers.

- [Sql Server DDL Triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/triggers/ddl-triggers?view=sql-server-ver16)
- [Oracle DDL triggers]

See following youtube video for oracle.
[Oracle DDL Trigger to log all database object changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiAPG2rP3sA).

Same concept also applicable in SQL Server.
