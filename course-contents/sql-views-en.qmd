# SQL views

Views allows you to store your select queries in databases.
It is very useful for abstracting especially common and complex queries.
The following figure shows a view that includes columns from multiple tables:

Views are common concept in databases and all databases supports it.
See documentation for our example databases.

- [sqlite views](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createview.html)
- [sql server views](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/views/views?view=sql-server-ver16)
- [Oracle views](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/cncpt/partitions-views-and-other-schema-objects.html#GUID-15E7AEDB-9A3F-4B31-AD2D-66253CC822E5)




**simple lab**


1. give Chinook database example, join query


```sql
SELECT A.Name AS ArtistName
, B.Title AS AlbumTitle
, T.Name  AS TrackName
FROM Artist A
INNER JOIN Album B
ON A.ArtistId  = B.ArtistId 
INNER JOIN Track T ON T.AlbumId  = B.AlbumId   
```

2. create view name as select statement

```sql
CREATE VIEW ArtistTracks
AS
SELECT A.Name AS ArtistName
, B.Title AS AlbumTitle
, T.Name  AS TrackName
FROM Artist A
INNER JOIN Album B
ON A.ArtistId  = B.ArtistId 
INNER JOIN Track T ON T.AlbumId  = B.AlbumId   
```

3. select from view.

```sql
select * from ArtistTracks;
```

**note**

Common example in the books is following:
In client-server databases, it could also be used to control access.
Instead of giving access to tables, you could give access to view itself. 
I have never seen this usage.


**note**

Views could be target of insert statements if rows in the views correspond to 1-to-1 to underlying tables, for example aggregate queries will never work. 

Sqlite allows this feature when the view is single table only.

I dislike this feature and never uses it.
