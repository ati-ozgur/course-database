## SQL Views materialized


Normally, selecting from a view is not different than using view query in subquery from statement.
Due to performance reasons, you may need results from views to be faster.
SQL Server and Oracle offers materialized views for this purpose.
Sql Server uses both indexed and materialized view for its terminology.
Indexed could be added Materialized views to make them more faster.


- [Oracle Materialized View](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/CREATE-MATERIALIZED-VIEW.html)
- [SQL Server indexed views](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/views/create-indexed-views?view=sql-server-ver16)


Other databases like postgre sql, IBM DB2 and  Sybase SQL Anywhere also support this concept


How frequently results are updated on physical storage is called refresh frequency.
These types of views could have problems with frequently updated tables but they are very useful for aggregate queries.
