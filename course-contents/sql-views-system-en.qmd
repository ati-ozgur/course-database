## SQL System Views

System views give dynamic information about the database system itself.

The most useful example to system views are SQL Standard Information schema views:
These views are used to get table, column, view and other object information from databases.

- INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
- INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
- INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS
- and others

See database specific documentation for this very useful feature from SQL Standard.
