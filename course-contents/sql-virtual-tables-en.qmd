# SQL virtual tables


Virtual table jargon is used for objects in the database where their data is not stored in database but they behave like tables in your sql statements.

Canonical example for virtual tables are views.
We create views, using CREATE VIEW statement, 

Normally, view data is not stored in our database but only query definition is data dictionary.
See views in course notes for more about this topic.


WITH statements also behave like virtual tables.
Subqueries in FROM Statements are also behave like virtual tables.

Some functions may return table like data and they may be considered as virtual table or inline views.
