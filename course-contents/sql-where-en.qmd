## IN Operator

```sql
select * from Employee where EmployeeId IN (2,5,9);  
```

## Between operator

## LIKE Operator

We use the so called wild cards while searching.
The characters % and _ are supported by almost all databases while others are supported less.



- [sql server wild cards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/wildcard-character-s-to-match-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)
- [oracle wild cards](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B13789_01/server.101/b10759/conditions016.htm)
- [sqlite wild cards](https://sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#like)

**examples in Chinook**

```sql
SELECT * from Customer c WHERE C.FirstName LIKE 'L%';
```

```sql
SELECT * from Customer c WHERE C.FirstName LIKE 'Lu_s'
```

Works in SQL Server

```sql
SELECT * from Customer c WHERE C.Address LIKE '%[12]%'
```


```sql
-- second character is a
SELECT * from Customer c WHERE  C.FirstName LIKE '_[a]%'

-- second character is NOT a
--SELECT * from Customer c WHERE C.FirstName LIKE '_[^a]%'
```

## Chaining of conditions

- Use parentheses when you need to chain more than 3 conditions.
Like mathematics, parentheses change the order of operations.

- (2+3)*5
- 2+3*5
