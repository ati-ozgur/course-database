## Reason 1: SQL is popular and widely used  {.unnumbered} 


SQL is the [number 8 in the tiobe index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/sql/).
Note that, SQL is new in this list since it was not considered programming language before 2018.
But as [same web page](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) says

> The programming language SQL was added to the TIOBE index in 2018 after somebody pointed out that SQL is Turing Complete. So although this language is very old, it has only a short history in the index.
