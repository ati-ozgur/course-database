# SQL With

With statements are also called Common Table Expressions or CTEs.
They are two types of CTEs.

1. Ordinary
2. Recursive

Ordinary CTEs behaves like views or from subqueries but they are more easy to understand compared to them.

They are easy to construct.
A simple example is given below.
We start with WITH and give name of the temporary result set. 
Between the parentheses, we write our query.
Then after the parentheses, we could select from this Name as if it is view or table.

```sql
WITH Name
(
)
select * from Name
```

See an example below, which make use of self join example of Employee table and query that temp table.

```sql
WITH EmployeeManager as
(
SELECT E.EmployeeID
      ,E.LastName AS EmployerLastName
      ,E.FirstName AS EmployerFirstName
      ,E.ReportsTo
      , M.EmployeeID as ManagerID
      , M.LastName AS ManagerLastName
      ,M.FirstName AS ManagerFirstName
  FROM Employee E 
  INNER JOIN Employee M
  ON E.ReportsTo = M.EmployeeID 
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeManager WHERE ManagerLastName LIKE 'A%'

```
