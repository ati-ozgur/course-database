## With Recursive

With Recursive is not included in the exam.


Oracle  CONNECT BY in 1980
But Recursive CTEs are better and standardized in SQL99 standard.
See database support in modern sql site.

a recursive CTE is a CTE that refers to itself in its select part

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
initial-select
UNION [ALL]
recursive-select
)
cte_query
```


```sql
WITH RECURSIVE num(x) AS (
SELECT 1
UNION ALL
SELECT x+1 FROM num
LIMIT 100
)
SELECT x FROM num;

```

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE num AS (
SELECT 1 as x
UNION ALL
SELECT x+1 FROM num
LIMIT 100
)
SELECT x FROM num;

```

The first thing to notice,we added RECURSIVE keyword to with.
The RECURSIVE is above not required for recursive CTEs in sqlite, Oracle and SQL Server but it is a good idea to include it to make it obvious for further maintainers of your system.
